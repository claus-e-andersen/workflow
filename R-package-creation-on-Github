This is my workflow for making a new R package and to make a connection
with Github using the Github Desktop application.

The main problem for me has been to connect Github with the specific
folder with my R package.

*** Step 1:
In Rstudio:
Select "New project" / "New directory" / "R package"
Select a name (e.g. clanENDF)
Check the box "Create a git repository"
This package could e.g. be located on your local hard drive at:
  <home> / data / R / github / clanENDF

*** Step 2:
From the command line in Rstudio:
  library(usethis)
  use_git()
  use_github()

The use_github() may not work if you do not have a valid
token for youe github account.

You can get a token (i.e. a Personal Access Token, PAT) from the github website 
(see profile / settings / developer settings).

Alternatively, you can use:
  library(gitcreds)
  gitcreds_get()
  gitcreds_set()

After having run use_github() sucessfully, you will have a repro on your
github account, e.g. called clanENDF.

*** Step 3:
You can now open the Github Desktop application.
Select "Add" / "Add an existing repository" 
Now navigate to the R folder with your package (e.g.  <home> / data / R / github / clanENDF).

*** Step 4:
You can now manage your package with Github Desktop (commit / push / pull etc.).
You will not need to commit anything from RStudio or to run use_git() or something
like that. 

*** Step 5:
During the development of the package, you will have to use roxygenise() and to run the install.
Make sure that you have run "More / Configure Build tools" and clicked the "Generate documentation
using Roxygen".
